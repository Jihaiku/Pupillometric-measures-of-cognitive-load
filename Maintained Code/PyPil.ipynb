    "## Context information\n",
    "I will be trying to implement three pupillometric measures from Duchowski's papers regarding: \n",
    "- 1) Index of Pupillary Activity (IPA)\n",
    "- 2) Low/High Index of Pupillary Activity (LHIPA)\n",
    "- 3) Reat-Time-Index of Pupillary Activity (RIPA) \n",
    "\n",
    "Which are all loosely based on Marshall's Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) from 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Index of Pupillary Activity\n",
    "The paper Duchowski et al. (2018) is the basis for this and it is the first iteration of their eye-tracked measure of the requency of pupil diameter oscillation. What this paper achieves is creating/replicating the Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) and in general improving upon it without necessarily being copyrighted. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version 1\n",
    "This version was created before I was aware that PyWavelet could do 90% of what I needed for the code. This can be found on the Github at this location. But is otherwise not up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version 2\n",
    "This version is the final one that is used within the implementation and is far cleaner code because of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPA Implementation\n",
    "There are roughly six formulas that are used within the paper to calculate IPA. Below we will go through each one and how they are implemented, what their variables are, and how they connect to one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wavelet Decomposition\n",
    "All of the five formulas listed below construct the first part of our python implementation from the Duchowski et al. (2018) paper. Each of them will be noted in their explicit part in the end result but are as such not hardcode calculated in this current version of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dyadic Wavelet Function\n",
    "The first of many functions, this one represents the wavelet function used in the analysis and is representative of the $wavelet$ argument in the function. For this specific rendition of the code, we assume that they are using the \"sym16\" version as that is what is used within the pseudo-code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this with the following variables:\n",
    "- $x(t)$: pupil diameter signal over time\n",
    "- $\\psi(t)$: the mother wavelet function \n",
    "    - (Symlet-16)\n",
    "- $j$: dilation parameter, integers from a set that can represent any number\n",
    "- $k$: translation parameter, integers from a set that can represent any number\n",
    "- $2^{j/2}$: Scaling factor w.r.t. time domain\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integral Transformation of Wavelet Coefficients\n",
    "This step is far more complicated as it goes through several iterations of it within the Duchowski et al. (2018) paper, but we'll mainly focus on the steps taht we can complete here.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For the sake of space, repeated variables will not be given descriptions)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Decomposition of the Wavelet Analysis w.r.t. coefficients\n",

    "- $c_{j,k}$: wavelet coefficients of $\\psi_{j,k}(t)$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inner Product Calculation of the Wavelet Coefficients\n",
    "This formula computes the wavelet coefficients by taking the inner product of the input $x(t)$ and tells us how well the function performs at different scales and translations.
